<p>I really enjoy programming. I mean, coding, developing, make great solutions, hands on project and happy hours with the team. So I consider myself a lucky guy since someone is paying me to do the work I like - the same work I quite often do for fun at home. Often spending my free time learning a new programming language or attending a crowded IT event or, of course, enjoying my family, cooking some homemade pasta, getting up early to 10KM, working hard on piano practicing circle of fifths so Bill Evans won't come back to tie my hands.</p>

<p>Unlike several friends, I did not attend computer science high school – that time I was dreaming about been a civil architect – but as soon as I got my first computer, the idea of construct software programs caught me up. Some time later I started programming in C/C++ and soon moved on to Java world. Java and all around is quite comfortable to me (since v1.2), where I spent most of my last 15 years. Yet, I'm always excited for cutting edge technologies and did some fun and great jobs using Ruby, Rails, Objective-C for iOS, most of them when founded my own company. Nowadays (2016) I’m playing with Scala and, mainly, Clojure.
</p>

<p>In books I believe so they are always around as much as my bash terminal – I’m a heavy-terminal-user – so I read as much as possible. My own GitHub is poor, I used to have a blog and a podcast, I gave feel presentations – so, I should contribute a little more. Anyway, I'm always helping who ask for - remnants of years teaching Java and related stuff at wistful Sun Microsystems.</p>

<p>That's all about me: programmer by definition, really friendly, I listen more than I talk, always very humorous, self and fast learner, practical. Looking forward to work in a skilled team building interesting software.</p>
